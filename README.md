# Lamin use cases

All notebooks in this repository are integration tests for LaminDB and run on CI.

- User [docs](https://lamin.ai/docs/guide)
- Developer [docs](https://lamin-usecases-ddcd.netlify.app/)

## More simple use cases run on CI

Also, the following use cases are run on CI, but have their own repository:

- [redun-lamin-fasta](https://github.com/laminlabs/redun-lamin-fasta)
- [nextflow-lamin-usecases](https://github.com/laminlabs/nextflow-lamin-usecases)

## Complex use cases not run on CI

In addition to integration tests running on CI for low-complexity examples, we also test LaminDB with a complex data history.

In the following repositories, notebooks are historical, versioned documents reflecting changes made to a LaminDB instance.

- [lamindata](https://github.com/laminlabs/lamindata)
- [lamin-site-assets](https://github.com/laminlabs/lamin-site-assets)
